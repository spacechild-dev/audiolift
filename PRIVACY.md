# Privacy Policy for AudioLift

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

## 1. Data Collection
AudioLift does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal user data, browsing history, or audio content on external servers. 

## 2. Local Storage
The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` to save your audio preferences (e.g., equalizer settings, volume levels, active presets) specifically for the domains you visit. This data:
- Remains entirely on your device.
- Is not shared with the developer or third parties.
- Is automatically removed if you uninstall the extension or clear your browser data.

## 3. Permissions
- **ActiveTab / All URLs:** Required solely to inject the audio processing engine into the web pages you visit to enhance sound quality. The extension does not read or analyze page content beyond detecting audio/video elements.
- **Scripting:** Used to inject the audio engine into existing tabs without requiring a page refresh.

## 4. Third-Party Services
AudioLift operates completely standalone and does not utilize any third-party analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising networks.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this policy, you may contact the developer via the links provided in the extension's interface.
